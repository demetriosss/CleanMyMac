# CleanMyMac
A few handy scripts for removing files from your personal Mac after using it for work.
Pretty simple, and I'll try to keep it that way. 

Each script is labled accordingly with instructions on how to customize it based on the 
nasty little programs that still seem to be lingering on your Mac after using it for work 
 -even if you've deleted the work user account.
This is not a guarantee of removal, nor do I take any accountability for you when you use these. 

I'd recommend checking both apple docs and whatever your prefrence of AI bot is to verify the script prior to running anything as a sudo user. 

With all that in mind, I hope someone finds these useful!
